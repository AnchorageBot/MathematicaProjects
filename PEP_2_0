*
*Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
*By starting with 1 and 2,the first 10 terms will be:
*1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...
*By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,find the sum of the even-valued terms.
