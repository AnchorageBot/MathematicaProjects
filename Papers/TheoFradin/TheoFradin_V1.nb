(* Abstract:

Well-posedness of the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean in isopycnal coordinates by Théo Fradi
- Pages 1 - 5

This script models the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean using both Eulerian and 
isopycnal coordinates. It includes the full system of equations, equilibrium solutions, 
perturbation analysis, and coordinate transformations. The model considers shear flows, 
hydrostatic balance, and the effects of stratification on fluid dynamics.

Glossary:
- Eulerian coordinates: Fixed spatial coordinate system for fluid dynamics
- Isopycnal coordinates: Coordinate system following surfaces of constant density
- Stable stratification: Condition where denser fluid lies below less dense fluid
- Shear flow: Flow where fluid layers slide past one another
- Hydrostatic balance: Equilibrium between pressure gradient and gravitational force
- Perturbation: Small deviation from a reference equilibrium state
- Sobolev spaces: Function spaces used in the analysis of partial differential equations

(* Note: This script sets up the mathematical framework for studying 
   the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean using both Eulerian 
   and isopycnal coordinates. It includes the full system of equations, 
   equilibrium solutions, perturbation analysis, and coordinate transformations. 
   The script is based on theoretical work in Sobolev spaces and considers 
   the effects of stratification and shear flows. Solving this system would 
   require advanced numerical methods and specific initial conditions. *)
