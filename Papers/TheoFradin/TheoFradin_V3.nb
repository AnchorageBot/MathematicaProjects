Well-posedness of the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean in isopycnal coordinates by Théo Fradin
- Pages 1 - 10
This script models the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean using both Eulerian and 
isopycnal coordinates. It includes the full system of equations, equilibrium solutions, 
perturbation analysis, coordinate transformations, and main theorem statements.
Glossary:
- Eulerian coordinates: Fixed spatial coordinate system for fluid dynamics
- Isopycnal coordinates: Coordinate system following surfaces of constant density
- Stable stratification: Condition where denser fluid lies below less dense fluid
- Shear flow: Flow where fluid layers slide past one another
- Hydrostatic balance: Equilibrium between pressure gradient and gravitational force
- Perturbation: Small deviation from a reference equilibrium state
- Sobolev spaces: Function spaces used in the analysis of partial differential equations

  "This result is to be compared with [DR22, Theorem 1.2], where the authors prove in particular the well-posedness of a system similar to (E), but with a regularizing term and a slightly different ansatz.",
  "Here the use of Alinhac's good unknown, presented in Appendix B, allows us to study the system (E) without this regularizing term.",
  "The ansatz that we use here allows us to keep the symmetry of the system (1.7) (see the term (iii) in the proof of Proposition 3.4).",
  "This result is in accordance with [DLS20, Theorem 2], where the well-posedness is established in Eulerian coordinates without any regularizing term, in the case of no background current V.",
  "However, note that the assumptions in [DLS20, Theorem 2] are more restrictive than the ones in Theorem 1.1.",
  "Namely, in the present study we do not assume that the Brunt-Väisälä frequency is constant, the strong Boussinesq assumption (i.e. that the density is assumed constant in the momentum equations, except in the buoyancy term b), nor the good preparation of the initial data, and we allow a background current.",
  "The downside is that the time of existence in [DLS20, Theorem 2] is of order √μ/ε whereas in Theorem 1.1, it is only uniform with respect to ε/√μ (in the case of no background current).",

  (* Continuing from the previous script *)

(* Remark 1.4 continued *)
remark14 = {
  "Let us discuss the smallness assumption on the shear velocity now. First notice that this implies that the Miles and Howard criterion (1.12) is verified for μ small enough.",

  "ω_total := (∂r V_total - ∇x^⊥ w_total, -∇x^⊥.V_total)",
  "Here, ∇x^⊥ := (-∂y, ∂x)",
  "Thus, the assumption of small shear velocity |V'|_∞ ≤ √μ yields that the vorticity at equilibrium is of order √μ. Together with the assumption ε ≤ √μ, this implies that the total vorticity is of order √μ.",

(* Remark 1.5 *)
remark15 = {
  "Let us finally comment on the regularity s ≥ s_0 + 3/2 needed here.",
  "Note that this is equivalent to s > d/2 + 2, where d + 1 is the dimension of the strip S_ε.",

}

(* Classical critical regularity *)
classicalCriticalRegularity = {
  "The classical critical regularity for similar results on the Euler equations is N/2 + 1, where N denotes the dimension of the domain occupied by the fluid.",
  "This discrepancy is due to the non-linearity introduced by the operator ∇x^F, namely recall the expression of the term ∇x^F P in (E)",
  "∇x^F P := ∇x P + ε (∇x η)/(1 + εh) ∂r P",
  "where h := -∂r η. On a technical viewpoint, this is the sharp regularity needed on η so that (∇x η, h) ∈ W^1,∞ by Sobolev embeddings."
}

(* 1.5. Perspectives *)
perspectives = {
  "As shown in this study, the energy method can be applied to the reformulation (E) of the Euler equations in isopycnal coordinates, without the regularization used in [DR22].",
  "This offers the possibility of using the reformulation in isopycnal coordinates for the study of stratified flows.",
  "One advantage of the isopycnal coordinates, besides the quasi-2D structure, is the rectification of the isopycnals.",
  "In the free surface case, assuming that the surface is initially an isopycnal, this change of coordinates also rectifies the surface (see for instance [DR22]).",
  "In this setting the free-surface case is quite close to the rigid lid case, and we expect that our study can be extended to the free-surface case with minor adaptations."
}

(* Additional notes on existence time *)
existenceTimeNotes = {
  "Recall now that under the assumptions of no shear flow, uniform stratification and strong Boussinesq assumption, Theorem 1.1 yields a time of existence of order 1 with respect to ε.",
  "However, with the additional assumption of good preparation on the initial data, [DLS20, Theorem 2] yields an existence time of order 1/ε with respect to ε.",
  "Therefore, it remains to study the phenomenon arising in the long-time dynamics when no assumption of good preparation is made.",
  "In [RL23], the authors perform a similar study, and show the existence of a boundary layer at the bottom."
}

(* Future research directions *)
futureResearch = {
  "Eventually, it would be of utmost interest to study a specific stratification that is ubiquitous in oceanography, namely two layers of (almost) constant density, separated by a pycnocline, where the density varies sharply but in a continuous manner.",
  "In [DLS20], the authors suggested to rely on the modal decomposition they introduced to obtain the two-layer shallow water equations as a limit when the thickness of the pycnocline and the shallow water parameter μ both tend to zero.",
  "The isopycnal coordinates seem a useful setting, as the isopycnals are straightened, therefore so is the pycnocline - which can be viewed as a blurred interface between the two layers.",
  "Relying on the regularization used in [DR22], the authors of [ABD24] proved the convergence of this continuous stratification with thin pycnocline setting towards the two-layer setting, in the hydrostatic case."

(* 1.6. Structure of the proof and plan of the paper *)
proofStructure = {
  "In Section 2, we show how the pressure is defined from the other unknowns through an elliptic equation.",
  "We derive in Subsection 2.1 a first set of elliptic estimates on the gradient of the pressure, showing how the standard strategy yields a loss of derivatives in the estimates.",
  "These estimates are then used in Subsection 2.2 together with Alinhac's good unknown to derive estimates without any loss of derivatives."
